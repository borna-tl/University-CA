In this project we have implemented a simple single-cycle MIPS processor which supports the following instructions:
* **Arithmetic/Logical Instructions:** add, addi, sub, slt, slti
* **Memory Reference Instruction:** lw, sw
* **Control Flow Instructions:** j, jal, jr, beq, bne

To check the processor's functionality, we wrote a program that calculates the sum of the elements of an array of size 10 (first element located at _address=1000_) and
stores the result at _address=2000_.
